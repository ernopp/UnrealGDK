# Get started: Introduction

We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide]({{urlRoot}}/setup-and-installing.md) to set up the GDK, its Unreal Engine fork, and our Starter Project. 

At this stage, you’ll have the stack set up and be able to run your first SpatialOS deployments - both locally and in the cloud - to get an idea of what the platform provides.

After this, check out the Multi-Server Shooter tutorial, where you can try out the GDK’s development experience by adding a new feature to the Starter Project and test it across two servers.

Finally, if you have an existing Unreal multiplayer project, you can follow our detailed porting guide to get it onto the GDK!
